                    The Insight Scoop is a podcast focused on discussing topics
                    about self-improvement, sharing interesting findings in the
                    world of tech, or just a pleasant evening chat. We are also
                    not afraid to go controversial and explore sensitive topics.
                    Silence is not the answer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are always open for new ideas, suggestions, or guests.
