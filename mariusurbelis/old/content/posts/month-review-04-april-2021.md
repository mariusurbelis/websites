## Month in Review April 2021

The month of April. What a month. I have finished my final project. University is kind of over. Not much else, this post will be short.

### Content Creation

If my daily shorts were the nuke, it's nuclear winter now. Complete writer's block. To be fair just as always. Feels like I am in this cycle. Create > face a block > get tired of being uncreative > start creating, etc.

### Gaming

The new ACC ACR GT3s season started. I'm racing the Lexus RC F GT3 this time.

### Career

The football season is over. PPV live streaming was my freelance gig. Still waiting for the full time job to start.

### Exercise

Purchased a gym membership. Will start from May.
