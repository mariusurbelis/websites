I am a Software Engineer at Unity.

[Photography](https://www.instagram.com/mariusurbelis/) and [videography](https://www.youtube.com/mariusurbelis) is something I have spent countless hours studying and practicing. I am currently working as a freelance videographer/live streaming specialist for DLR Media.

I host a weekly podcast (currently on a break) called [The Insight Scoop](https://www.theinsightscoop.com/). When I feel inspired I create some [music](https://soundcloud.com/mariusurbelis) too! My current proudest achievement is [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mariusurbelis) affiliate.

I am interested in both design and programming. Main example being this website. It is like my little corner on the vast interweb. I usually self-host. My server names: Juno, Nox, Pen and Ares.

So, now that you know me and my digital friends, letâ€™s [connect](../contact)!

Thanks for reading!
